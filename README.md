# Ed&Dragons Campaign Journal
As a DM I find I am enjoying the use of a markdown editor with dynamic links called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). While this is great for me, the players sometimes don't get the benefit of having all this information at their fingertips - such as a list of NPCs who they have encountered, including images, info about where they reside etc. The lack of access to such information can make the deeper story difficult to follow for players, especially if sessions have several weeks between them. 

The eventual aim of this project is to create an online management system for DMs, who can selectively share information with players based on the campaign they're in. The general categories will be npcs, locations and the journal itself - which will have all the session summaries in easy to read format, as well as any in game notes and letters they have found (with appropriately cool styling applied). The dynamic routing of sveltekit is perfect for creating such a site.
