A trading town situated in on the Silent  Loch in the centre of Murraka. A population of around 5000 people, mostly pilgrim, tough hardworking individuals who set out to make a new life for themselves across the Great Sea, and those who came from wealth and status seeking a new life or seeking to unravel the mysteries of the island of Murraka. Murraka is on the way to  the new lands and the tales of rich mines and fertile land drew folk here. People strangely do not want to leave the life they have set up, despite the rising threats of the Pirates and the Lizardfolk. A minor militia act as police force in Rivermine known Colloquially as "Legs".  They operate under the rule of the five hands who each have authority over them to some degree.

Rivermine and the surrounding Fiefdom is governed by a democratic called [[The Fair Council]] which is composed of guilds or "Arms" of Trade, Mining, Agriculture, Knowledge, Trade and Religion. Each Arm has a hand, the leader and representative for each guild. The Hand for each aspect was traditionally of a specific race which harked back when Murraka was first settled over a hundred years ago.

The town is split into three levels, and four quarters: the Docks level 1, the Markets level 2, and then the Cliffs and Pastures on level 3.

## The Docks  
<span style="color: pink; font-style:italic">Smells: Fish, Sweat and Wet Wood</span>
<span style="color: orange; font-style:italic">Sounds:  Cries from boats, chatter, slosh of water</span>

Life by the Docks is where the action is happening. It is where the traders first make port, and deal with the Dockwarden at the Dockgate. Traders must register first here before being allowed to trade in Rivermine proper. All personnel are recorded upon entry to be let through, this is because of the rising threat from the pirates. Here in the Docks are many food stands and some low to medium lodgings for those who do not wish to enter the town. It can be a little bit rougher round here as a consequence. Most folk end up somehow at the [[Drunken Tortle]] for a drink and a tale.

## The Markets
<span style="color: pink; font-style:italic">Smells:  different foods, smoke from chimney</span>
<span style="color: orange; font-style:italic">Sounds: Clink of coin, bartering, ring of blacksmith, town crier, clock bell</span>

Also bustling and full of life, there's plenty going on at the markets. One can find a number of different food types here including the exotic things going on from the jungle. Strange fruits, roasted insects and all manner of trading from [[nick-nacks]] to serious exchange of large quantities of metals and  gems. Most of the serious trade goes on in the [[Trading Hall]], where the [[Mining Arm]] and the [[Trading Arm]] operate from.

## The Pastures
<span style="color: pink; font-style:italic">Smells:  manure, mud, grass, fresh rain, grain</span>
<span style="color: orange; font-style:italic">Sounds: Creak of carts, whinney of horses, lowe of cattle</span>

The Pastures are where the agriculture is centred. All the crops and livestock are looked after here and it is a very important part of Rivermine. One of the oldest parts as early settlers had to get things going on the good soil early on. There's plenty of minor competition between the farmers though, although they all do their bit. A lot of older folk live here wanting to be closer to the forest and further away from the riff raff, but not being wealthy enough to move to the Cliffs.

## The Cliffs
<span style="color: pink; font-style:italic">Smells:  Freshly baked bread, flowers</span>
<span style="color: orange; font-style:italic">Sounds: Gentle chatter, guards walking, chanting from church</span>

The Cliffs are where the money and status lives. With real stone walls and where the guards are most heavily established. Here there are more expensive shops and a number of manor houses, aswell as the Occularium and the Seminary font - these two guilds are often head to head, as are the somewhat the miners and traders and farmers guilds. Prices are high here, and folk walk around feeling safe showing their fine jewellery and clothing.
