# Description
Situated at the tail end of the [[Rivermine#The Markets |Rivermine Market District]], close to the gates. Built into a raised complex of stone and masonry, stone steps lead up the side to a butchers shop. Thick racks of meat hang outside curing when the weather is good, otherwise he has a cold room - kept chilly with a magical orb emitting gentle wisps of frost. Anyone who goes around the side gate will notice a small face-height hatch on the heavily bolted and barred iron door. This is where fenced goods come and go.
