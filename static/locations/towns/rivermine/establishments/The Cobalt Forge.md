# Description
Short squat building, always merrily churning out smoke from the forge. The tiles on the roof have been stained blue or are made of some blue stone giving the building the impression that it is covered in dragon-scales

<span style="color: pink; font-style:italic">Smells: smoke, hot coals and metal filings</span>
<span style="color: orange; font-style:italic">Sounds: continuous ringing of the hammer on the anvil, occassional sizzle of the work being quenched</span>
