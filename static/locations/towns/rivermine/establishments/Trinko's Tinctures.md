# Description
A dingy squat building with strange acrid aromas lingering around the outside. Situtated in the Markets near the slope up towards the gate. After pushing through the door there is a dusty and strange mixture of smells which seem to undulate and change over time. A workshop is dug into the cliffside hidden by a heavy beaded curtain.
