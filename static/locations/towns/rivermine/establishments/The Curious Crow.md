# Description
On the edge of the Markets overlooking the Docks. A small little building with all kinds of wind chimes and dream catchers hanging outside.
<span style="color: pink; font-style:italic">Smells: wafts of floral incense and heavy perfumes that sting the eyes a little</span>
<span style="color: orange; font-style:italic">Sounds: a gentle tinkling bell sounds on arrival, wooden chimes softly play their sporadic music</span>
