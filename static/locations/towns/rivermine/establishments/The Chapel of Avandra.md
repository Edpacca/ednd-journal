# The Fighting Pit
The floorboards leak the sounds and cries of folk battering the shit out of each other in an undergruond fighting ring. Kept out of the eyes of the guards as Rivermine has fairly strict laws although some are aware of it they are told to leave things be. 

## Betting
- Fights are bet on and handled by a book keeper
- Some of the clergy will use the chapel gold (marked with the changebringers face) which is all returned back to the chapel at the end of the  night
- wagers are 1:1 - you get back what you put in

## Rules - Knockout or Submit
5 rounds of 60 seconds each. In each round:

- Each combatant rolls 3 attacks, sums the total, and subtracts the opponent's AC.
- The combatant with the higher value receives a point for every critical hit landed as well as every multiple of 10 by which their total exceeds their opponent's total.
- The combatant with the lower value makes a Constitution Saving Throws with the DC equaling '10 + 3x(points opponent received this round) + 5x(number of Constitution Saving Throws failed)'.
- A combatant is KO'd and loses the match upon failing 3 Constitution Saving Throws or failing a Constitution Saving Throw by 10 or more.
- If after 5 rounds no one has been KO'd the victory goes to the combatant with the most points. If combatants are tied for points another round is added until a win condition is met.
