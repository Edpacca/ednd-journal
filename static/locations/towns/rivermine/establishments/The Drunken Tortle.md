# Description
A great old tavern building hung on the side of a cliff, perched on some high rocks in between the Docks and the Markets. The sides looks swollen like the wood is sagging, there are a patchwork of repairs and boards which don't detract from the liveliness that spills from the warm windows. Music and laughter, shouting and belching are always heard. A rickety wooden stair leads up to the front on the dock side, and there is also access through a hatch on the top of the cliff and a climb down a ladder. Inside is spacious and seems to be half dug into the side of the cliff. A warren of cellars and levels make up the inside which has a main bar area, some small side rooms and plenty of lodging. They have a small brewery in the back which is Hal's pet project, although he mostly delegates to others these days.
