# The Deeds of the Gangbangers: Chapter I 

## Session 1

Set sail for Murraka aboard  The Loyal Gull, arrived in Bromtor on the isle of Nimbral. Ailish and Barathol entered a local tournament called the Lumber, competing against some local lumberjacks and a crew member from the Gull called Orbon. Ailish won, gaining a gemstone as his prize. While the tournament was taking place, guybrush deftly stole the gold that the bookie had taken in bets... In the morning they stumbled across a tomb inhabited by goblins whilst searching for  Wortroot for Arran Stenner, at the behest of Aelnor.

## Session 2

After raiding the Tomb, they found a magically sealed box inside a coffin. On the way back to Bromtor, they found Orbon being beaten up by local lumberjacks on suspicion of robbing the kitty... the Gang went to calm things down (Except Guybrush who snuck off) and dispersed the lumberjacks. Orbon made a deal with Barathol for a pearl that the dwarf had been eyeing up the night before. Following this they set sail once more for Murraka and arrived in  Rivermine! Had drinks at the  Drunken Tortle, learning a bit about the island from  Hal BoneBack. Malereus hit on a tiefling bard called  Layline Layla, while Guybrush won a gambling game against  Rakkas, a jovial dragonborn.

## Session 3

The gang began to explore Rivermine. After suggestions from Hal, they picked up quests from Angus Orefoot the blacksmith ( The Cobalt Forge) and Trinko the alchemist ( Trinkos Tinctures). Aelnor headed to  The Occularium to introduce himself to the archmage but was met with a short tempered  Spellwarden, who informed him that the Archmage was too ill for visitors; he sent Aelnor on a mission to prove his worth by investigating a host of Steam Mephits at one of the Occularium's recorded research sites in the Jungle.  
  
With new purpose the Gang headed into the jungles of the  Scalewood after recieving gold, up-front, from Trinko for delivering some potions to his friend  Kribbin (The Hermit) who lives on  Hermit Hill. They were attacked by vicious insects en-route and Guybrush and Ailish were poisoned; Ailish called upon his patron deity Illmater and cleansed the poison from their bodies! After finding Hermit Hill abandoned, they discovered the Hermit being attacked by several Dryads (wood nymphs from the Fey Wild). They rushed in and fought a close battle against the charm and thorny restraint abilities of the Dryads. Krebin and Ailish fell in the conflict, but the last enemy was slain just in time. Guybrush administered a potion to Ailish before he bled out, returning the earlier favour...

## Session 4

After healing Krebin using the  Goodberries dropped by the Dryads, the Gang spent the night at Krebbin's hut, sharing stories and asking questions. Krebin dispelled the magic on the strange box discovered earlier revealing the  Nimbral Scroll inside. He told you of the Mages of Nimbral, an ancient race who presided on the Isle of Nimbral, and here on Murraka long ago. He told tales of  The Dawnbreakers, a legendary adventuring party active until around 30 years ago. Their last known location was deep within the Plains of Deceipt, where they are rumoured to have perished. This location is the same one the appears to be drawn on the Nimbral Scroll.

## Session 5

The Gang headed back into the  Scalewood, discovering the home of the Steam Mephits, after Barathol cannonballed into the pool disturbing the creatures and provoking combat! The weak mephits proved no problem until the huge Manticore exited from the adjacent cave, nearly slaying Ailish, Barathol and Malereus before a well-timed  Ice Knife from Aelnor dropped the creature. While everyone was healing up, Guybrush snuck into the cave finding some jewels and a  Tiny Notebook - accounting the escape of a slave from the clutches of an organisation who's banner bears a blood red octagon upon a black field. Known as the Onyx Company, these slavers are apparently afiliated somehow with the Pirates of  Rockfleet.

## Session 6

Instead of heading immediately back to  Rivermine, the now self proclaimed 'Gangbangers' headed towards the mining town of  Pickfort to check up on a shipment due to be delivered to  The Cobalt Forge which hadn't showed up.. Upon arriving they were told that the shipment had left Pickfort on time on a cart so something must have happened en route. Infact their two guys, Glint and Krogi never returned. Before heading along the road though, the boys entered into an intense drinking contest with the foreman Krag Irongull! Everyone threw up, although Barathol was the last man standing. 

After narrowing down the search for the cart they found evidence of a small struggle near the Fortune Bridge. They tracked the cart to the edge of the jungle and headed inside. They passed through a swamp and were attacked by giant frogs, Aelnor nearly getting swallowed whole. Eventually they discovered an outpost occupied by Lizardfolk. They rushed in and made short work of the surprised Lizardfolk, who all exhibited strange markings and mutations to their skin - small appendeges and extra frills, cast in a bluer tinge than is normal for Lizardfolk. 

## Session 7

After killing the Lizardfolk they found two dwarves, Krogi (the cart driver) and  Naddodd. The second cart driver Glint was apparently taken by the Lizardfolk after they discovered he had experience working with metals. Naddodd had met the other two dwarves on the road where they were all waylaid by the Lizardfolk and dragged to this cave. Naddodd decided to join the gangbangers as they all headed back to Rivermine.

They claimed a reward from Angus Orefoot at  The Cobalt Forge for returning his  Cobalt Ore, and he shared with Barathol the first of his family's secret knowledge in how to smelt the strange material. 

Aelnor returned to  The Occularium to inform them of his completed quest - alas the Spellwarden was not present and his apprentice Jarvis met Aelnor instead, and gave him a second very similar task to investigate some mud mephits in the simmering bog. A high ranking mage,  Tevior Aruthil caught Aelnor's attention and drew him into his office for a chat. He warned Aelnor to be cautious of the Spellwarden and asked to be informed of anything suspicious, but wouldn't elaborate. He also inducted Aelnor formally into the Occularium's ranks as an Initiate. 

Young Arran Stenner ran into Aelnor as he was leaving and gifted him a potion of waterbreathing, crafted by  Trinko from the  Wortroot that was recovered from the tomb in Bromtor. 

The gang heard a rumour that a lady named Margaret was accused of murdering another man who's body had been found, after last being seen with her. Margaret had kindly taken Naddodd into her home, and he thought this strange. After investigating her empty home, they found a letter which led them to the graveyard on the edge of town, and discovered a long tunnel leading underneath the Silent River itself.

Following the rough tunnel for a few hours leds them to a coarse bushy clifftop which was swarming with undead roving around unchecked. A bloody battle fought in the rain left the Gangbangers standing soaked in mud and gore, standing before a strange lighthouse emanating a sickly green glow...

## Session 8

Before attempting to enter the lighthouse the gang investigated a path leading south, to a cabin where two thugs were holed up with their pet badger. After some intimidating remarks the pair, known as _Gerald_ and _Thick Tony_  admitted to digging up bodies on behalf of a "scary man" named _Melcior_ who paid them, saying he liked to take female victims into his lab for "experiments". Meanwhile Guybrush climbed up on the roof of the lighthouse spying more zombies inside.

The heavy hitters smashed through the front door while Guybrush and Aelnor sniped from above after smashing the glass. They cleared the top floor and descended to the next, a dark room lit only by faintly glowing green vats. Realising only too late that one was smashed and an odd creature, a tentacled brain was floating towards them. The thing stunned and nearly took out half of the party before being taken out. They discovered a chest which was trapped with poison gas, taking Guybrush's last few hit points, before revealing some  Sending Stones a strange crystal and  Melcior's Notes revealing his research into the strange materials found on Murraka.

The room had no obvious exit, but a scrawl found on a map revealed a code which unlocked a secret door to the next level. Barathol snuck down the spiral stairs, but was nearly crushed by a giant club, he was seen legging it back up a minute later persued by a bunch of grasping undead hands! Malereus' eyes went pitch black as he summoned demonic tentacles which dispatched of the hands with ease.

## Session 9

After taking a beating from the zombies, the brain and hearing something large roaming around downstairs they decided to close of the bottom floor and rest on the top. During this time, Malereus who often was overheard talking to himself and behaving strangely seemed to have a terse conversation with something unseen before informing the gang that he had to leave. He stood up and stalked out of the lighthouse into the dark and the rain without another word... and hasn't been seen since. 

The remaining adventurers headed down, after a sneaking Guybrush, who managed to see a lanky figure with strange eye pieces descending on some mechanical contraption to a lower level underground. They launched an assault on the undead ogre remaining in the room and slew it. Amongst a series of pipes pumping steam and greenish fluids around the lighthouse they discoverd the shaft that the man went down, descended a long way down and the lift was at the bottom. Guybrush attempted to shimmy down but slipped and fell the whole way! Despite the fall he was able to raise the lift for the others who rode the unstable metal contraption into the depths. 

A set of heavy doors stood at the end of a dark corridor, erratic blue flashes showed underneath. Pushing through revealed an expansive multileveled laboratory filled with odd machines producing sputtering lightning illuminating a grisly rusted chair surrounded in blood, a piled of bodies piled high next to it. The slender dark robed figure with the glasses stood at the back next to a collosal organ and several large levers. He pulled the levers down activating two lightning rods next to the party which started emitting bolts of electricity around the room. A small cage on the upper level contained prisoners, on of whom was instantly fried by a bolt. The Gang charged across the floor to deal with this evil being, who began playing the organ which summoned bodies from the pile of corpses. A bloody and intense fight eventually led to the death of Melcior, recovering some magical items and a spellbook from his corpse and freeing Margaret and a gnomish girl from the cages. The other soul was not so fortunate... 

But thus, the Gangbangers dealt with their first series of challenging encounters and slew a formidable foe.
