# The Deeds of the Gangbangers: Chapter II

## Session 10

After rescuing  Margaret and the Gnomish girl named Mitsy they made camp under the stars, recovering from the horrible scenes beneath the lighthouse. Barathol immediately passed out while Mitsy told them she was born in  Clinking, the secretive Gnomish settlement to the south. But she was kicked out and left to become a member of a pirate crew in the settlement of  Rockfleet. She told them she served under _Captain Merlino_ for a while until she left when things started to get heated between the three Great Captain clans who make up Rockfleet, serving under someone known as the Dread Prince.  Ailish expressed interest in finding these pirates and she gave them  a note which would call in a favour and might earn them an audience with Merlino if they wished.

The gang then returned to  Rivermine, claiming a gold reward for solving the murder. Naddodd had his trident sharpened and got a chain attached, while Barathol purchased a  Miniature Tame Mimic. Ailish and Guybrush met a shady looking halfling in the  Drunken Tortle named  Kef Blackwater who decided he liked the cut of their jib and proposed a job for them. They were to pick up a delivery from Rockfleet and drop it off with the butcher, Munton Oatsnout for a fair fee. They rowed out to  Spire Isle and met with a gruff individual - managing to smuggle the goods into town via a guarded loading dock after Ailish pretended to be drunk and drowning. 

The lads made a plan to head to  Rockfleet via the  The Jungle Temple which was pointed out to them by Krebin the hermit. Forgetting how grueling the jungle could be they almost stumbled into an ambush and were attacked by a swarm of giant spiders. The crushed the leggy bastards and continued to the temple, finding tracks outside indicating lizardfolk may be inside.

The temple lay high up on a steep rocky outcrop, poking above the jungle canopy. Water was pouring from an opening down into a pool below. Strange runes adorned every surface and odd statues holding dishes could be seen from the top of the stairs. The rogue snuck in but triggered a crude trap and combat ensued! A much closer battle was fought resulting in Ailish's armour glowing red hot from the voodoo magicks of a lizard shaman, who was poised about to run for reinforcements whilst the gang dealt the final blows to the lizard warriors infront of them.

## Session 11

The shaman headed down the corridor and just managed to push open a door allowing others to rush into the fray. Strangely these "enemies" appeared to be a female priest accompanied by two thuggish gentlemen. It was a close and bloody brawl but the gang prevailed with no casualties but needed to rest to regain their senses. 

They explored further towards the rushing water and encountered a black ooze which corroded some of Naddodd's prized trident! This area of the temple was completely flooded in knee deep water, and there were many  wall carvings which showed the temple to be of Nimbralian origin, the same as the box which they discovered on their first venture - the carvings gave insight into their strange magical philosophies. Barathol found a deep blue crystal in an alcove next to an archway, set against the wall. Once he removed it the water drained from the room. The crystal appears to be the same material as the one detailed in   Melcior's Notes but a different attunement. The wall carvings translate their name to  Shards of Ether.

Pressing through to the other side of the temple led to Ailish setting off another trap, and drawing the ire of yet more lizardfolk, these ones bigger and angrier charged from a room emanating a deep green pulsing light. The light was coming from a dark orb on a pedestal which ensnared the minds of some of the gang who pressed too far forward! Fortunately they were able to just about defeat the lizardmen and smash the orb before too many of them were turned. 

After a long day of killing things they went outside to rest and reflect on what they'd learned.

## Session 12

After resting up they headed back into the temple to uncover the last of it's secrets. After finding out the temple was a Nimbralian temple dedicated to elemental air, they used the statues and dishes to direct the strong airflow from outside through the passages and revealed a hidden area containing many treasures.

Another hidden corridor led to a cowering dwarf who turned out to be Glint! They also smashed through a magically sealed door and found the corpse wearing robes of  The Occularium and a  Bloodied Spellbook containing the dying messages of its former owner. Glint asked if they'd accompany him back through the forest but the gang declined having other business to attend to. While he pressed through the woods Naddodd won a strength contest hurling the stone dishes from the front of the temple.

They set off to traverse the Glittering Mountains, passing out of the dense jungle into beautiful mountain vistas and rocky terrain. Barathol spied a herd of abnormally large goats ahead, but as he was stalking up the huge form of a dragon passed overhead and grabbed two goats in its collosal claws before ascending through the clouds towards the peak of Mount Fortune. 

Pressing on towards the only sensible pass East through the mountains they encountered a blockade. A guard shouted that they standing down in the name of the Onyx Company. Before they could really take it in, the gang were attacked by the guards and a captain in heavy armour. However they understimated the Gangbangers and were slaughtered fairly quickly, leaving only a fleeing duergar running East towards the plains. Ailish, overcome with some primal fury sprinted after the dark dwarf and tackled him to the ground. Intimidation loosened his tongue and he revealed that  The Onyx Companyare a group of slavers who are working a mine just north of here, and have built an oupost there. They have some affiliation with  Rockfleet. The mines are led by a nasty Duergar named Garruk Trollpike. The Duergar told them that the outpost is heavily fortified and that Garruk and his band are a force to be reckoned with, but leave occassionally on business to Rockfleet and to another headquarters elsewhere.

## Session 13

Ailish revealed the somber reason for his prescence on the Isle of Murraka, after tracking the group of slavers who had attacked and raided his home village - killing many of his friends and loved ones and giving him a reason the pick up the art of the flail... which he demonstrated by smashing the unconcious duergars head against the rocks. 

They searched the bodies and found a  a letter on the captain detailing patrol schedules - this group were set to be relieved at noon the following day. They found some horses sequesterd in an old carved out cave at the side of the pass and attempted to tame them. With the new information they spent some time going over their options and coming up with a plan to help Ailish free his brethren. They took the now bloody uniforms of the guards and cleaned them up and put them on, and with everyone except Barathol mounted on horseback they set off to the North-East to try and gather more information about the  Onyx Company Mining Outpost.

En route, they encountered a strange hunchbacked individual who was a little standoffish at first, spooked by the uniforms.  After a little back and forth he revealed himself to be Mr Bucket, a wandering trader, and produced several rare, wondrous and fairly expensive magical items from the depths of his "bucket", an oversized wooden container that he seemed to haul on his back. Guybrush purchased a paid of magical boots that can be used to conceal ones tracks, and for once, decided not to try and take any shiny things. After the exchange, Mr Bucket, who seems to have a knowing glint in his eye prodded at the fact that their uniforms didn't really fit and he also didn't know any normal dwarves who served in the Onyx Company... Aelnor informed him that the Onyx controlled pass would be briefly open for passage. With a sly wink Mr Bucket shuffled off across the plains.

Down the road they could spy the outpost and decided to find a place off the beaten path to make camp and tether the horses. Guybrush snuck up ahead to observe the outpost, relaying his observations through the sending stones. It was quite smoggy due to the mining operations but he managed to deduce that the place was quite heavily fortified, the slaves are kept in a grim looking building at the back when they aren't in the mines, and that the outpost was smelting the ore on site. Two different groups of carts were seemingly being loaded up for transportation.

## Session 14

After spending the night in a crevase a mile south of the  Onyx Company Mines, Barathol woke from a strange dream, whereby the location of a  rare crafting material was revealed to him.

The Gangbangers headed to  Rockfleet and bribed their way in, in style. They witnessed a proving, a battle at in an Arena called  The Martyrs Pit between a groups of warriors from the crew of  Great Captain Lazarus and  Great Captain Merlino. The fight was won by Lazarus men, apparently earning the right to legalise slavery and formally promote an alliance between the  The Onyx Company and Rockfleet.

The gang sought an audience with Merlino and revealed their quarrell with the Onyx Company. Merlino raised an eyebrow at the Onyx Captain's badge, but asked them to prove themselves. A group of his best warriors have not returned from a hunting mission - he hand-waved the details, just go investigate, recover a powerful greatsword and bring back the head of whatever it was in there that they failed to kill.

Chor assigned  Kara to mind the gang, who prompty went off to get pissed. Barathol headed to the blacksmith, a one legged goliath named  Eagle Killer. After trading, Eagle killer identified the strange ore found that morning to be  molybdenum, a material which he has figured out how to incorporate into bludgeoning weaponry to enahnce it. Barathol eager to learn more, and Eagle Killer eager to share the knowledge, the two spent the day smelting and swapping stories. Meanwhile Guybrush encountered the poisoner  Skeemo Weirdbottle and purchased some wares. 

Later, the GBs spread out at the lively pub  the Chattering Crab, gambling and aquiring rumours. Barathol drank late into the night with Eagle Killer whilst Ailish found himself in the company of a saucy Goblin girl from Captain Cinder's crew. 

## Session 15

After waking from what, for some, was a night of heavy drinking - the Gangbangers roused themselves, found Kara and headed out towards the cave where Merlino's men supposedly entered and never returned. Finding the cave entrance inside the ruin of a small Nimbralian outpost, they headed within..

After hearing some sounds of creatures arguing and the clatter of pots and pans, the guys launched an assault upon a small group of Kobold's they encountered near the entrance. Continuing within they discoverd a cave room flooded with water with a possible opening near the back - they decided to come back and headed deeper within where several oddly lifelike statues were found surrounding the entrance to a deep tunnel. 

The tunnel lead to a cavern, wherein resided a terrifying monster - a bull-like entity with a metallic hide who charged! They wore the creature down quite quickly, but got a nasty surprise when it resleased a torrent of acrid green fumes in Barathol's face... the creature charged back to take a deadly running gore attack, as Barathol felt his limbs siezing up he prayed to Gond and unleased a bolt of divine energy which struck a near fatal blow. But as his companions finished the beast off, his vision fade and his flesh turned to stone, freezing the dwarf in eternal petrification, his hand outstretched and face determined. 

## Session 16

The jubilation at slaying the gorgon was short lived, upon realising no one had any answers for curing their dwarven ally. The gang headed deeper into the cave system where they were ambushed by large rock-tunnelling insectoids which they bashed up. Guybrush, being Guybrush, tried to sneak off while the others were cleaning up the mess but was struck down by a rolling log trap. They encountered a tribe of wary and skittish kobolds, who began to worship the gangbangers for slaying the creatures which plagued their tunnels - in return they gifted them with the meagre treasures they possessed and Merlino's greatsword - petrified with a stone hand still gripping the hilt. 

Somewhat downtrodden they hacked the head off the gorgon and returned to Rockfleet, meeting Kara on the way to Nero's Fin, Merlino's flagship. Merlino was happy they had recovered the sword and over the moon about his new trophy. Merlino's archnavigator  Yundi raised two possible avenues for reversing petrification: beseeching the archnavigator of the Dread Prince, a mysterious and powerful man feared amongst a community of rapscallions and smugglers, or to see if Skeemo at  The Devil's Drop had anything in store. Merlino seemed strongly opposed to owing any favours himself to the Dread Prince. The Devil's Drop it was. 

Unfortunately, Skeemo had apparently sold his last stock of a rare tincture prepared from basilisk blood just earlier that day - what rotten luck. He was reluctant to relinquish his customer's identity so the gang headed off to the pub to wait for his shop to close and Guybrush could do his thing. At this point, Naddodd had a change of heart and claimed he was leaving to find his father - the thing he'd come to do in the first place. Farewells were said.

Later, whilst the usual night time festivities were in full swing, the gang staked out the alchemists shop - Aelnor casting a spell to turn Guybrush invisible, who then slunk up to the front door and deftly picked the lock. He noticed a thing glistening silver thread around the doorframe but decided to push in anyway. Carefully making his way to the counter, he just about jimmied the stiff lock on a draw open, to find a leather records book. At this point, Skeemo returned having been alerted by some magical alarm, , despite an attempt by Ailish to distract hm. Guybrush, his heart in his throat, climbed up the back wall and perched on a window sill - easing open the pages to the last entry which read:

> 2 x Tincture of Basilisk Oil: 1200 gp - Garuk Trollpike, Onyx Company

## Session 17

After reading the name, Guybrush cursed silently and tried to figure a way to leave. Ailish called from outside the door to Skeemo, but the Gnome quickly cast a spell on the door sealing it shut. The distraction was enough for guybrush to drop silently to the floor. The draw was still open and he managed to slip the book back inside and shut it, although it remained unlocked. Skeemo at this point began to get nervous, realising that noone had robbed his shop, so they must be here for something else. He called out fearfully the name Zukaro...apologising for failing at some unknown task. Guybrush used this change to etch a "Z" into the countertop and snuck to the front of the shop whilst Skeemo headed to the counter - upon seeing the "Z" he panicked and began to unlock the trapdoor behind the counter, descending below. Guybrush used this chance to hop out of the window at the front, taking a cloud of poison gas to the face as he tumbled out landing, invisibly, with a thump next to Ailish.

The gang began to hastily leave but Ailish was stopped by a group of brutish pirates from the crew of Lazarus - not believing his attempts to decieve them a fistfight ensued. Guybrush attempted to tackle the leader, dropping his invisibilty but Aelnor appraoched from behind and paralyzed one with an arcane utteration giving the others a chance to escape. Giving the pirates the slip they managed to make their way to  The Leaky Bilge a tavern primarily occupied by the crews of Cinder and Merlino. Kara was pressed for information at this point revealing that Zukaro is the Prime-Mate, the Dread Prince's second in command. A cunning black furred tabaxi who had announced the results from the Martyr's Pit fight just the day before.Tired and relieved at having made it out of some close shaves the gang slept. 

In the morning, enjoying food prepared by Kara, they stood atop the deck of Nero's Fin and watched a merchant vessel escorted into the bay by one of Lazarus' raiding ships. The surviving crew members held at cutlass point on their knees on deck while the pirates piloted the vessel into port. The gang heard that the first now legal slave auction was to take place in the market that day - they decided to check it out before figuring out how to recover the Basilisk Oil. 

Ailish jumped atop a crate to observe the market and his heart stopped when he recognised two of the slaves to be acutioned were members of his raided village! Martha and Perrin. His triumph was short lived when he spied the nasty visage of the female halfling  Roke Bagger skulking in the shadows. Before hopping down he overheard conversation between two  Onyx Footmen who claimed Garuk had sent his recent purcahses back to the Onyx Outpost - which was going to be undermanned for another day or so before reinforcements arrived from elsewhere. 

Bolstered by this knowledge, Ailish implored the gang to use their coin to bid on the halflings. Messages sent by both Kara and Aelnor alerted the halflings that they had friends about, and to make themselves look weak and undesireable. These messages may have been overheard by the two guard though, who headed off to Roke's tent. She slunk out and spotted Ailish, sending the guards to retrieve him - but they were fooled by Guybrush and brought him over instead. A threatening and tense conversation was had but she realised he was a different halfling and sent the guards back out - by this point, Kara had successfully purcahsed the two halflings and was making his way back towards the entrance. A final inquisition by Roke revealed she knows about the attack at the mountain pass and is on the hunt for the culprits. Ailish managed to escape out the back and the gang hastily made their way out of the Rockfleet market, the midday sun beating down upon them.

## Session 18

Deciding to take advantage of the fact that the outpost would be undermanned, the Gangbangers headed north across the plains. They encoutered some kind of rock elemental but Kara made it afraid with his bardic magic and it fled. Just as the outpost came into view they hatched a plan - Aelnor and Kara disguised themselves as guards with an illusion while Ailish and Guybrush pretended to be prisoners. 

Reaching the gate they were of course questioned, Aelnor's acting skills nearly gave them away if it wasn't for a swift charm spell cast by Kara on the head guard. They had made it inside but were forced to head towards the slave encampment rather than the fort itself to maintain their act. 

A second set of guards stood at the entrance to the mine, another close call and they made it inside but didn't report to the captain as they said they would which roused the suspicion of the guard who had questioned them. Seeing no alternative, Ailish bopped him on the head and a quick, but messy fight led to the two guards lying dead at their feet inside the main tunnel of the mine. Fortunately the loud clang of tools seemed to have masked the scuffle, and there was enough dirt to cover the blood. 

Aelnor had turned Guybrush invisible giving him a chance to snoop around the mine. He saw many groups of workers guarded by Duergar, toiling away. With guybrush now invisible, Aelnor and Kara still disguised and Ailish dressed in Onyx Company gear, they were ready to try and infiltrate the fort.

## Session 19

Heading carefully back into the courtyard, it seemed as if no one had taken note of their presence. With his fey beast companion, Arctor, Aelnor was able to spy a ridge running along the back of the outpost, which may lead close to the back of the Fort offering a way in without going through the front. The sharp eye of Guybrush spotted a ladder leading up to the ridge and they made their way over. 

Upon reaching the Fort they hid until the guard leaning on the balcony at the back had finished his tobacco break, and Kara used a Bardic ability to transport the entire group safely across the 30ft gap. Finding only one door open, Guybrush slipped inside and distracted the guard so the others could enter.

They found themselves on a second floor level overlooking a great hall below where several soldiers were eating noisily. Slipping across to a set of ornate doors Guybrush slipped inside again, witnessing a conversation between a Hobgoblin and a Duergar. He found himself in a once luxuriously decorated dining suite, littered with discarded food and decorated with training dummies. Before he could stage a distraction, a wee old woman wondered passed the group waiting outside, paying them no heed, and entered the room mumbling.

Guybrush took the opportunity to cause a distraction by opening a large barrel of wine to spill all over the floor! When the Duergar got up to see what had happened he struck from behind. A battle ensured where the Hobgoblin let off a burst of lightning from his wand which nearly took down Aelnor and Ailish. Suits of animated armour nearly finished off Aelnor, knocking him unconcious. The Gangbangers were victorious but made a significant amount of noise...

## Session 20

Before the Gang had a chance to lick their wounds the guards from downstairs jumped into the room. Blasting one of the guards off the balcony led to him running away and looking to get help. Time was off the essence and after dispatching the remaining enemies the Gang began frantically searching around for Garruk's quaters. Ailish broke into a room coverd in dried blood and found a near dead human strung up at the side. Giving the man his last health potion Ailish nursed him back to life but he was too disorientated to help in any way. Grabbing a strange headband on the side they headed to where Garruk's quaters were supposed to be.

Guybrush picked the lock and swiftly entered the room, only to be met by the sharp end of a heavy spear trap which left him bleeding out on the floor. Having no more health potions or healing abilities the Gang began frantically searching around. Ailish found some vials and bottles and managed to figure out which one was a health potion before Guybrush was lost. Grabbing the reamining bottles, some important looking letters to Garruk and grabbing a shield off the wall, they looked for an escape route. The guard had reached the barracks at this point and it looked like there was little time...

Smashing the window and with a timely use of featherfall the Gangbangers + random torture victim leaped from the top floor of the fort descending to the ground below and beginning their dash to the exit! Those few extra seconds were valuable and they just made it to a group of horses whilst crossbow bolts filled the air around them. The random man fell to these relentless volleys and several of the gang took shots to the back as their horses galloped towards the closing gate!

A final push and attacking the guards who pushed the gates bought just enough time for them to slip through and gallop off into the afternoon sun across the plains. Heading straight for their pal Barathol they carefully applied what they determined to be Basalisk oil to Barathol's stone body and watched the colour gently return to his form. 

They spent the evening catching up and examining their spoils. Not to mention the contents of the letters to Garruk which raised a lot of questions.
