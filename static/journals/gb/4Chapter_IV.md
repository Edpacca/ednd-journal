# Session 31

The gangbangers landed in a shallow pool with a waterfall, behind which the gentle sparkle of the portal from which they had emerged was visible. They were attacked by pantherlike creatures whose forms flickered with some strange energy. After dispatching of them and finally resting after an incredibly long day - they set off into the woodland that surrounded them. They figured out they must be in the scalewood in the center of Murraka, based on what was visible to Arctor, Aelnor's owl companion who spotted Mt Murraka, the volcano in the center of the island, and Mt Fortune - the largest mountain where Pickfort is situated. 

Making their way through the dense jungle was tiresome and difficult to keep a course in the right direction. As they trudged through Ailish realised they were being followed. Eventually a scrawny lizardfolk teen revealed itself and asked them to follow, rather than seeming hostile. They obliged and met with a small band of younger lizardfolk, barely surviving in a makeshift camp, and an elder lizardfolk shaman who was wounded. The Shaman, in broken common, told them that their village known as Borak, was once prosperous and healthy - but a miasma took their people's minds away and most of the village left to go north to the larger lizardfolk settlements, driven by some strange disease which addled their minds. They were driven out by large creatures which occupied the empty buildings. He said that this was prophesised and known to have happened once before, and his village had a special crown which would protect their minds from the miasma. If they could retrieve it for them then they would help them out of the scalewood via the known warrens and paths which the lizardfolk use. 

They agreed, being good adventurers, and headed towards the village

# Session 32

The elderly shaman pointed them to the entrace of the village, a collection of stone buildings set in a clearing in the jungle around the ruins of what was probably another nimbralian temple. They entered carefully, or so they thought, behind the lead stealth expert guybrush. As he crept forward hugging the shadows, a large clank was heard as Barathol and Ailish clattered into each other. A swarm of small reptilian bipeds rushed out of a building and attacked. Guybrush, being a smart cookie, rushed ahead thinking he would get a head start on the looting - only to be ambushed by a group of slightly larger dinosaurs... he was struck down and on the brink of death (twice) before the group managed to kill the attacking creatures and rescue their rogue. This involved Aelnor summoning a group of magma mephits to aid them.

Nursing their wounds they began to explore the village, and Guybrush and Ailish found an exit to one of the buildings had been covered up deliberately with branches and foliage. Pulling it aside they were greeted by a maddened expression worn by a somewhat familiar Dwarf, named Glint, who had been rescued previously from the Nimbralian air temple....

# Session 33

Glint was wild looking, unclean and mad. His eyes darting back and forth as he stammered out warnings not to come near. He was very protective over an object kept in a sack cloth on his back. While Guybrush and Ailish tried to calm him down, Barathol had a vision in another hut - a clay pool filled with lava beckoned him forward and formed briefly into a smiling face - he felt the light of Gond fill his heart as the surface morphed into a cog, spinning faster and faster. it rapidly changed into a map of the Murrakan Islands and a raised portion on the South island, near to where Clinking was indicated on the map, rose into view. The vision zoomed in on this location and a city like structure emerged from the surface of the lava before bubbling down and running away into the base of the clay pool. 

Aelnor watched Barathol drooling and gently rocking back and forth as he stared into an empty clay pool.

After this the group convened on the Glint situation. It was obvious he was cracked out when they asked abouth the thing on his back and he became incredibly defensive, a flash of green light briefly flickering across his eyes. Not taking this shit, Barathol tackled Glint to the ground and held him down while Aelnor removed the item from the room. Glint calmed down as soon as it was out of sight and had no memory of what had happened. He told how he kept trying to make it back to Pickfort but would periodically black out and wake up further North. He eventually decided to try and hole up here for as long as possible until he was discovered by the Gangbangers. 

Aelnor and Barathol stepped outside and appraised the object, a polish carved onyx monkey, one hand raised by its side with a finger pointing upward. As Guybrush stepped out to see what was going on he was suddenly struck by the desire to have this object... slipping it out of their grasp he charged into a corner and tried to stuff it into his bag. He responded ferally to any pleas from the gang to chill the fuck out. Eventually chaz lifted Guybrush off his feet while Barathol stuffed the idol in the bag of holding. Guybrush, like Glint, immediately calmed down and had no memory of what had happened once the idol was out of sight. For good measure though, Chaz dropped him down a well.

The others continued to explore, discovering a large freshly devoured carcas and blood soaked earth to the back of the village, and Aelnor saw a huge nest of some sort. Barathol, whilst picking through the rubble of the temple, tripped, almost falling into an exposed chamber. Guybrush, now out of the well, spoke to Glint but when he mentioned the statue the Dwarf lost it again and started to froth at the mouth and attack the halfling - Guybrush knocked him out. Deciding to investigate the chamber they all headed down, leaving Glint near the entrance. 

They discovered a room with 3 sarcophogi surrounding 4 raised tiles. An archway to the far end of the room looked like it had an entrance to somewhere else but it was solid stone. Bartathol began rituatlly casting a spell. Aelnor got Chaz to lift him up to inspect some dark blue crystals that were hanging above the coffins. Upon touching it a green wisp of light drifted into the sarcophogus - passing right through the lid. A moment later the stone exploded blowing everyone backwards and a cackling skull wreathed in green flames flew out throwing a fireball at the group. This caused some pandemonium and resulted in Ailish stepping on a tile causing a second flameskull to emerge. Thinking quickly they smashed open the coffins and tried to damage the skulls before fully animating. This helped and they emerged victorious, if a little singed. 

Barathol sat down and did his ritual again, melding through the stone wall before the rest could figure out the puzzle. Eventual trial and error opened the door to reveal a smug Dwarven cleric holding a great leatherbound tome with thick pages of vellum. At this point they heard a scream.

Evacuating the chamber they witnessed poor Glint in the jaws of a collosal beast, stood on two legs with tiny arms and a giant head filled with rows of sharp teeth. Glint was chomped and swallowed before it roared and attacked. The Gangbangers had grown considerably in strength and managed to nuke down the beast in a short time before it could do any real damage. Slicing open it's gut Barathol pulled out the mangled corpse of Glint and sorrofully began preparing a funeral rite. The others found a circular metallic band which looked to match the description of the crown they sought. 

A funeral was held for Glint, in the spot where they had found him. Aelnor conjured a rose while Chaz beat a funeral march on a drum he had found. Ailish wiped some of the gore (which was probably part of Glint once) off a tooth that he had taken from the beast onto the grave. Barathol poured some wine onto the grave while Guybrush sprinkled some peanuts that he had found in Glint's pocket onto the soil.  

# Session 34

After Glint's short but poignant funeral the Gangbangers assessed their options. Barathol was eager to see if they could identify the city on the South Island, which appeared to him in his vision from Gond - Chaz knew of but one city there called Clinking. A Gnomish settlement and the old home of a friend of his, Mitsy. However, a more pressing matter was to visit the Dread Prince in Rockfleet and figure out what had happened with that traitor Nailik.. 

Barathol identified the metal crown that they had located in the lizardfolk village as being nothing remarkable other than a pure band of a metal which was unknown to him. A brushed slightly pinkinsh surface, extremely light but very hard. It was reminiscent of a collection of unidentified ores that was located in the Sunken Citadel. The Lizardfolk Shaman eagery awaited their return and was grateful when the crown was presented to him. 

The Lizardfolk led them out of the Jungle and towards the plains. They made camp and Barathol fiddled with the strange cube that was found in the Sunken Citadel. Despite cleverly identifying an intricate manipulation of this strange mechanism, the device let out a cloud of noxious gas in response. 

Packing up in the morning they set out on the Eastern plains of Murraka - down around the edge of the glittering mountains and down towards Rockfleet. Aelnor spotted a couple of ships heading towards a cluster of islands about 15 miles off the eastern coast. Chaz had overheard in the court of the Dread Prince that the leaders of the Onyx Company had occupied an abandoned fort there which is possibly where they might be headed? 

Pressing on late into the night, squeezing the last few miles out of the day the Gangbangers arrived at the edge of Rockfleet late into the night. Immediately it was obvious that something wasn't right, a vast sickly green light spread out from the centre of the Dread Fort - leaking beyond even the boundaries of the pirate settlement. The shanty town was also abnormally busy and occupied with legions and legions of onyx company troops, filling up the tented area known as the Canvases. Chaz cautiously approached the gates hoping to talk his way back in. The others watched in confusion as he began to pick up speed and headed right through the gate without even glancing at the guards, and without any movement from them...

Guybrush followed and also broke out into a run, passing through the gate. Aelnor was concerned as Barathol, and then Ailish followed suit. The Elven Wizard steeled himself and stepped across the threshold into the light.... and felt an itch behind the eyes. Despite his Elven heritage, the itch blossomed into a familiar caress and gently wrapped around his mind. One by one the Gangbangers had succummed to the allure of the light. Gazing lovingly up they hurried towards the source of their new family, across the bridge, through the gates and up the stretching stone stairs to the centre of the Dread Court. All the while feeling the comfort of being surrounded by their brethren - and protected by... something. 

Arriving in the center of the hexagonal room, it's high rough stone cieling stretching above with tall thin alcoved windows on each wall - surrounding a wide heavy-set table on which were heavy vellum maps and scrolls laid out with small wooden markers. The Dread Prince, Dante the Reckoner, lounged in a tall-backed black oak chair - as always a hood pulled forward shading his thin pale features. Delicate lips curled into a smile as they realised who you were and welcomed you back. Flanking behind the Dread Prince was the towering minotaur Bishek and his sallow, dark robed priest Ulmanor. The green light was almost a gentle mist in here, but still present, if a little subdued. Studying you all he welcomed you back. 

Ailish stepped forward and asked what had happened to Nailik - as the thought of Nailik flashed through each of their minds, the shadow that clouded each of their free will was lifted just slightly. For a fraction of a second the reality of the situation was realised. For a fraction of a second. Only Aelnor and Chaz (both with nat 20s) snapped back and shrugged off the charm. Aelnor's sharp intellect rationalising the situation whilst Chaz being driven by strong emotions of anger and hurt at being betrayed. Aelnor kept up the guise that he was under the spell but for Chaz it was too much. He grabbed Barathol and began to shake the dwarf, but to no avail. Bishek stepped forward to grasp Chaz's arm but he shook free - he turned to run as a bolt of necrotic energy slammed into the wall above his head, but was fast enough to break into the most powerful of sprints down the stairs and into the courtyard. 

The rest of the gangbangers were ordered to give chase. Aelnor making it down the stairs out of eyeshot of the others just long enough to fire off a message to Chaz that he was free too. For now.. 
Guybrush being the fastest managed to almost catch up but just as Chaz leapt up to the battlements - using his greataxe to break the chains above the gate causing it to slam shut as he dropped to the other side, running off into the night.

# Session 35

As Chaz sprinted out of the dread fort the horde of pirates and soldiers outside eerily shifted themselves to face him as one and began to attack him and attempt to stop him leaving. Several axes landed but a bloody chaz charged on through and began to make for a row of tents. He lit of a torch and set fire to a nearby tent to cause a distraction. Ailish caught up with him with seveal uses of misty step but Chaz yelled and thrust the torch into his face causing him to momentarily snap out of the mind control, just enough for him to gain his composure and shake off the charm. Aelnor took to the skies and flew after them as chaz made a final charge through waves of halflings attempting to slow them down and they escaped - Ailish had taken a detour and escaped too. 
Guybrush returned to the dead fort to find Barathol completing his rituatl incantation to commune with his god.

When Barathol made the connection he found the way blocked by an ancient, dark and terrible entity which filled his mind's eye, bright green glowing shapes for eyes amongst a writhing mass of dark tentacles - the thing revealed its name to be a gutteral noise that sounded like "M'rrrka". Barathol stood firm and in maintaining his sense of faith reached out to Gond who pierced the cloud of darkness with a ray of warm sunshine - this gave Barathol a sliver of a chance to break his mental entrapment and gain his faculties back!

Realising he was in the Dread Court with Dante, Barathol lied and said he had found the location of the escapees and would take Guybrush to go and find them. The dread prince pierced him with an intense gaze before smiling slightly and nodding in agreement.

# Session 36

As Barathol and Guybrush left the Dread Court the Dread Prince insinuated to Ulmanor that he should go and recover Zukaro who should have "completed his transformation" - the Dread Prince mentioned something about "his (Zukaro's) shadows" and then instructed Bishek to go and begin his own transformation and expressed curiosity as to what gifts the master would bestow upon him.

Barathol and guybrush hurried out towards the place where the others had escaped and made for the foot of the mountains. The others made out the approaching shapes and revealed themselves so that Barathol and Guybrush could make it up the rocky scree to their position. As they moved over the edge Barathol shouted that Guybrush was still under the spell and Aelnor cast hold person while the others tried to snap him out of it. Barathol eventually reached into his bag and pulled out a faintly glowing ingot of ostensibly the same metal that the Lizardfolk's crown was made of. As he pressed it to the forehead of Guybrush the enchantment seemed to dissapate and Guybrush was freed! 

Heading deeper into the mountains they found a spot to camp, hidden out of the way by rock moulded by Barathol. Barathol sat down and used his holy magics to forge a set of platinum rings from his coins - he gave one to Guybrush and kept one for himself. During the night Aelnor witnessed a collosal shadow of a dragon sweeping overhead as they slept.

In the morning Guybrush revealed a ring that he had stuck on his hand, which had been bothering him more and more recently and he believed was linked to his recent... compulsions. As the glove came off and the ring was revealed he began blurting out "I stole this ring from Qyrraptir the mightiest beholder!". Barathol cased removed curse and the ring became loose on Guybrush' finger and slipped off easily - he revealed this is the first time it had come off since he had stolen it several months ago back in Calimport. He was on the run from the wealthy nobleman that he had robbed and snuck aboard the ship to Murraka at the last minute. He pocketed the ring though, relieved that he was no longer cursed...

The group made their way through the mountains and towards the mining town of clinking. They met with the Foreman Krag Irongull and Momogin Strongdigger, head of Rivermine's mining arm, and relayed their story so far - from finding Glint, twice, the Monkey statue and the Rockfleet situation. At the mention of the Monkey Idol the dwarves looked uncomfortable and told a tale of a Dwarf named Arno Brecken - a master miner and member of Pickfort who 5 years prior had discovered a whole vein of magically infused crystals that the Occularium folk are interested in. After returning with a team to excavate, a single member of the team returned screaming something about a Monkey statue - the Dwarf named Klank now lives in solitude in the Clocktower and is stark raving mad. The others never returned and mine was boarded up and deemed "unsafe". 

It also turned out coincidentally to be the evening of the monthly Pickfort Drinking contest...
